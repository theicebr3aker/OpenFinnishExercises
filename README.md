# OpenFinnishExercises
Open-source exercises for Finnish learners

### Motivation
There are some good Finnish tutorials freely available on the web, and you can usually get some courses (free or paid, depending on many factors).
But you may discover that bottleneck is the lack of practice (unless your course is really intensive). So the app's goal is help you master
the language by practicing some grammar.
